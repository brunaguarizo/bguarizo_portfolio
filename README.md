# Bruna Guarizo Portfolio Website

## Technologies

-   React
-   Vite
-   JSX
-   CSS Modules
-   React Router DOM - for navigation

# Why React

I chose React for this portfolio website because of its component-based architecture, which enables modular and reusable design. React's component system allows me to build reusable UI elements like buttons, cards, and navigation components that maintain consistency across the entire site. This modular approach makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
